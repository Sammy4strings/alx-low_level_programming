An if statement can be followed by an optional else if...else statement, which is very useful to test various conditions using single if...else if statement.

When using if...else if..else statements, there are few points to keep in mind âˆ’

An if can have zero or one else's and it must come after any else if's.

An if can have zero to many else if's and they must come before the else.
